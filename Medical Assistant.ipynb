Some possible triggers for this condition include stress, genetics, viral infections, and certain medications.\\n\\nThere are several treatments that have been shown to be effective in addressing sudden patchy hair loss:\\n\\n1. Corticosteroids: These are anti-inflammatory drugs that can help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system's attack on the hair follicles. They can be applied topically or taken orally, depending on the severity of the condition.\\n2. Minoxidil: This is a medication that has been shown to promote hair growth in some people with alopecia areata. It works by increasing blood flow to the affected area and stimulating hair follicles to produce new hairs.\\n3. DHT blockers: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a hormone that can contribute to hair loss. Some people with alopecia areata have high levels of DHT in their scalp. Finasteride and dutasteride are medications that can block the production of DHT, which may help promote hair growth.\\n4. Immune system modulators: These drugs work by suppressing the immune system's attack on the hair follicles. Examples include methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine.\\n5. Hair transplantation: In some cases, hair transplantation may be an option for people with alopecia areata who have large bald patches that don't respond to other treatments. This involves taking healthy hairs from another part of the scalp or body and transplanting them into the affected area.\\n\\nIt's important to note that there is no cure for alopecia areata, and not all treatments work for everyone.

Fever: A fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher may be present in some cases of appendicitis.\n","5. Constipation or diarrhea: Both constipation and diarrhea can occur with appendicitis, depending on the location and severity of the inflammation.\n","6. Rebound tenderness: This is a sign of inflammation in the abdomen. When pressure is applied to the abdomen, the pain worsens when the pressure is released.\n","7. Guarding: People with appendicitis may involuntarily contract their abdominal muscles to protect the affected area from further discomfort or injury.\n","\n","Appendicitis cannot be cured via medicine alone. Antibiotics may be used to treat any accompanying bacterial infection, but they do not address the underlying inflammation in the appendix. Surgery is the only effective treatment for appendicitis. The most common surgical procedure for treating appendicitis is an appendectomy, which involves removing the inflamed appendix through a small incision in the abdomen. This procedure can be performed as an open surgery or laparoscopically (using small incisions and a camera to guide the surgeon). The choice of surgical approach depends on various factors, including the severity of the condition, the patient's overall health, and the surgeon's preference.\n","\n","It is essential to seek medical attention promptly if you suspect appendicitis, as delaying treatment can lead to complications such as perforation (rupture) of the appendix, which can result in severe infection, abscess formation, or even sepsis. Early diagnosis and timely intervention with surgery can help prevent these complications and improve the chances of a successful recovery.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["It is observed that upon increasing the max_tokens parameter, we are getting more descriptive reponse."],"metadata":{"id":"w_L-6ILvdZxj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dRp92JQZOeff"},"source":["### Query 3: What are the effective treatments or solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss, commonly seen as localized bald spots on the scalp, and what could be the possible causes behind it?"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Assigning the query to a variable\n","query3a = \"What are the effective treatments or solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss, commonly seen as localized bald spots on the scalp, and what could be the possible causes behind it?\"\n","# Printing the response of query by changing the top_p parameter\n","print(response(query3a,top_p=0.8))"],"metadata":{"id":"JOgATEpMRPve","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"b908438a-b30a-40e1-e4f7-08462b5f7da9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1765035235612,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":21953,"user":{"displayName":"AMIT RATHOR","userId":"08674596575798700971"}}},"execution_count":56,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Llama.generate: prefix-match hit\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n","Sudden patchy hair loss, also known as alopecia areata, is a common autoimmune disorder that affects the hair follicles. It can result in round or oval bald patches on the scalp, but it can also occur on other parts of the body such as the beard area, eyebrows, or eyelashes.\n","\n","The exact cause of alopecia areata is not known, but it's believed to be related to a problem with the immune system. Some possible triggers for this condition include stress, genetics, viral infections, and certain medications.\n","\n","There are several treatments that have been shown to be effective in addressing sudden patchy hair loss:\n","\n","1. Corticosteroids: These are anti-inflammatory drugs that can help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system's attack on the hair follicles. They can be applied topically or taken orally, depending on the severity of the condition.\n","2. Minoxidil: This is a medication that has been shown to promote hair growth in some people with alopecia areata. It works by increasing blood flow to the affected area and stimulating hair follicles to produce new hairs.\n","3. DHT blockers: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a hormone that can contribute to hair loss. Some people with alopecia areata have high levels of DHT in their scalp. Finasteride and dutasteride are medications that can block the production of DHT, which may help promote hair growth.\n","4. Immune system modulators: These drugs work by suppressing the immune system's attack on the hair follicles. Examples include methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine.\n","5. Hair transplantation: In some cases, hair transplantation may be an option for people with alopecia areata who have large bald patches that don't respond to other treatments. This involves taking healthy hairs from another part of the scalp or body and transplanting them into the affected area.\n","\n","It's important to note that there is no cure for alopecia areata, and not all treatments work for everyone.
